# DEFRA statutory biodiversity metric tool

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a work in progress. Reach out to hello@abitat.dev to contribute.

The code here provides an open source, generally available version of the
[statutory biodiversity metric calculation tool](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-biodiversity-metric-tools-and-guides)
published by [DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs).

The aims of this library are:
* directly mirror the existing spreadsheet calculation tool
* remain compatible with the spreadsheet format to enable seamless read/write with either tool
* work in all javascript environments (server, web, serverless)
* document and test the functionality/inner workings of the calculations

By doing so, we wish to facilitate better tooling for BNG.
